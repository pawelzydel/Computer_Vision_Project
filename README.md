# Computer Vision project

The aim of this project is to create a neural network model that classifies images related to smiles. A dataset containing celebrity images is used for training and testing. Image processing techniques such as normalization and convolutional layers are employed to train the model to recognize smile-related patterns. The project concludes by focusing on visualizing the training results using accuracy and loss curves.
